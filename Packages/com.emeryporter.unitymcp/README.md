Unity-native [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server for AI-powered game development. Connect Claude, Codex, Cursor, and other AI assistants directly to the Unity Editor — no Node.js, Python, or external runtimes required. Install the package and start building.

---

### New in v2.2

Canvas UI building tools, Input Action management, Project Settings management, batch execution, and merged vision capture.

---

## Features

- **100% Unity-native** — Runs entirely inside the Unity Editor as a single package. No sidecar processes to install or maintain.
- **Zero telemetry** — Completely private. No data leaves your machine.
- **51 built-in tools** — Create GameObjects, run tests, build projects, manage scenes, build Canvas UIs, manage input actions, and more.
- **23 resources + 6 resource templates** — Read-only access to project settings, scene state, console output, and more via URI patterns.
- **4 workflow prompts** — Pre-built prompt templates for common Unity tasks.
- **4 built-in recipes** — One-call scene setup templates (FPS prototype, UI canvas, 3D template, physics playground).
- **Checkpoint system** — Save and restore scene state before destructive operations, with diff support.
- **Vision capture** — Send Game/Scene View screenshots directly to AI assistants for visual analysis.
- **Scene diagnostics** — Narrative scene summaries and structured issue scanning in one call.
- **Remote access** — Connect from other devices on your network with TLS encryption and API key authentication.
- **Activity log** — Monitor MCP requests and responses in real time from the editor window.
- **Per-action annotations** — Safety hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`) resolved per action, so AI assistants get accurate signals even for multi-action tools.
- **Simple extension API** — Add custom tools, resources, prompts, and recipes with a single C# attribute.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 or later (including Unity 6)
- Any MCP-compatible AI client: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, or others

## Installation

1. Open Unity Package Manager (**Window > Package Manager**)
2. Click **+** > **Add package from git URL**
3. Enter the URL for the version you want

### Latest version (recommended)

```
https://github.com/emeryporter/UnityMCP.git?path=/Package
```

### Specific version

Append a `#version` tag to pin to a release:

```
https://github.com/emeryporter/UnityMCP.git?path=/Package#2.2.0
```

See [Releases](https://github.com/emeryporter/UnityMCP/releases) for available versions.

## Setup

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add unity-mcp --transport http http://localhost:8080/
```

### Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:8080/"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### Other MCP clients (Codex, Cursor, etc.)

Unity MCP exposes a built-in HTTP server at `http://localhost:8080/`. Any MCP-compatible client with HTTP transport support can connect directly. For stdio-only clients, use the `mcp-remote` bridge as shown above.

*Note: Configurations for clients other than Claude Code have not been tested. Open a PR!*

## Configuration

### Editor window

Open the Unity MCP control panel from **Window > Unity MCP**:

<img src=".github/editor-window.png" alt="Unity MCP editor window showing the Status, Activity, Registry, and Checkpoints tabs" width="400">

The editor window has four tabs:

- **Status** — Start/stop the server, view the endpoint URL (with copy button), see tool/resource/prompt/recipe counts, configure the port, and manage remote access settings.
- **Activity** — Live feed of MCP requests with timestamps, status indicators, and expandable detail panels showing arguments and response metadata.
- **Registry** — Searchable catalog of all registered tools, resources, prompts, and recipes. Organized by category with annotation badges and expandable parameter details.
- **Checkpoints** — Browse saved checkpoints, restore or diff scene state, view tracked assets, and check bucket status.

### Port

The default port is `8080`. To change it:

1. Stop the server.
2. Enter a new port number in the **Status** tab.
3. Click **Apply**.
4. Start the server.

### Verbose logging

Toggle **Verbose Logging** in the editor window to enable detailed debug output in the Unity Console. Useful for troubleshooting connection or tool execution issues.

### Remote access

Enable remote access to allow AI assistants to connect from other devices on your network:

- **Toggle remote access** in the **Status** tab to bind to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
- **TLS required** — Unity MCP auto-generates a self-signed certificate for secure connections.
- **API key authentication** — A key with the prefix `umcp_` is auto-generated on first enable and required for all remote requests.
- **Copy or regenerate** the API key directly from the editor window.
- **Endpoint** changes to `https://<LAN_IP>:<port>/` when remote access is enabled.
- **Certificate storage** — Stored in `LocalApplicationData/UnityMCP/`. Auto-regenerates if your LAN IP changes.
- **Firewall** — You may need to allow incoming connections on the configured port. This is your responsibility.

#### Claude Code remote setup

```bash
claude mcp add unity-mcp --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://<LAN_IP>:8080/
```

Replace `<API_KEY>` with your generated key and `<LAN_IP>` with your Unity machine's IP address.

## Architecture

Unity MCP is entirely self-contained within the Unity Editor. A native C plugin runs the HTTP server on a background thread and persists across Unity domain reloads, so the AI assistant connection stays active even while Unity recompiles scripts. No external processes, runtimes, or sidecar applications are needed.

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  MCP Client     │
│  (Claude, etc.) │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ HTTP(S) POST (JSON-RPC)
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Proxy Plugin (C)                   │
│  - HTTP server on background thread │
│  - Persists across domain reloads   │
│  - Buffers request, waits for       │
│    response from C#                 │
└────────┬────────────────────────────┘
         │ Polling (EditorApplication.update)
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unity C# (main thread)             │
│  - Compilation gate: defers         │
│    requests while isCompiling       │
│  - Routes to MCPServer handlers     │
│  - Executes tools, reads resources  │
│                                     │
│  Services:                          │
│  - CheckpointManager (scene state)  │
│  - RecipeRegistry (scene templates) │
│  - UISchema (Canvas UI definitions) │
│  - Response dedup cache (defense)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**During script recompilation**, the C# compilation gate defers request consumption until the domain reload completes. The AI assistant sees a brief delay rather than a disconnection.

## Extending Unity MCP

<details>
<summary>Adding custom tools</summary>

There are two ways to define tools: an **action-based tool** for grouping related operations under one tool name, and a **single-method tool** for standalone operations.

### Action-based tools (recommended for related operations)

Place `[MCPTool]` on a static class and `[MCPAction]` on each action method. The framework generates a unified JSON schema with a required `action` enum parameter.

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityMCP.Editor;
using UnityEngine;

[MCPTool("enemy_manager", "Manage enemies in the scene", Category = "Gameplay")]
public static class EnemyManagerTool
{
    [MCPAction("spawn", Description = "Spawn an enemy at a position",
        DestructiveHint = true)]
    public static object Spawn(
        [MCPParam("type", "Enemy type", required: true,
            Enum = new[] { "goblin", "skeleton", "dragon" })] string type,
        [MCPParam("x", "X position", required: true)] float x,
        [MCPParam("y", "Y position", required: true)] float y,
        [MCPParam("z", "Z position", required: true)] float z)
    {
        GameObject enemy = new GameObject($"Enemy_{type}");
        enemy.transform.position = new Vector3(x, y, z);
        return new { instanceID = enemy.GetInstanceID(), type };
    }

    [MCPAction("list", Description = "List all enemies in the scene",
        ReadOnlyHint = true)]
    public static object List()
    {
        var enemies = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Enemy");
        return new { count = enemies.Length };
    }

    [MCPAction("despawn", Description = "Remove an enemy from the scene",
        DestructiveHint = true)]
    public static object Despawn(
        [MCPParam("instance_id", "Instance ID of the enemy to remove",
            required: true)] int instanceId)
    {
        var target = EditorUtility.InstanceIDToObject(instanceId) as GameObject;
        if (target == null) return new { success = false, error = "Enemy not found." };
        Object.DestroyImmediate(target);
        return new { success = true };
    }
}
```

**Annotation resolution for action-based tools:**
- `destructiveHint = true` if **any** action has `DestructiveHint = true`
- `readOnlyHint = true` only if **all** actions have `ReadOnlyHint = true`

The server uses per-action metadata to tell AI assistants which specific actions warrant a checkpoint before proceeding, rather than flagging the entire tool.

### Single-method tools (for standalone operations)

Place `[MCPTool]` directly on a static method:

```csharp
using UnityMCP.Editor;
using UnityEngine;

public static class MyCustomTools
{
    [MCPTool("hello_world", "Says hello to the specified name")]
    public static string SayHello(
        [MCPParam("name", "Name to greet", required: true)] string name)
    {
        return $"Hello, {name}!";
    }

    [MCPTool("spawn_enemy", "Spawn an enemy at a position with difficulty scaling",
        Category = "Gameplay", DestructiveHint = true)]
    public static object SpawnEnemy(
        [MCPParam("enemy_type", "Type of enemy to spawn", required: true,
            Enum = new[] { "goblin", "skeleton", "dragon" })] string enemyType,
        [MCPParam("x", "X position", required: true)] float x,
        [MCPParam("y", "Y position", required: true)] float y,
        [MCPParam("z", "Z position", required: true)] float z,
        [MCPParam("difficulty", "Difficulty multiplier (1–10)",
            Minimum = 1, Maximum = 10)] float difficulty = 5)
    {
        GameObject enemy = new GameObject($"Enemy_{enemyType}");
        enemy.transform.position = new Vector3(x, y, z);

        return new
        {
            instanceID = enemy.GetInstanceID(),
            type = enemyType,
            difficulty
        };
    }
}
```

Tools are automatically discovered on domain reload. No registration needed.

### Tool annotations

Set annotations on `[MCPTool]` for single-method tools, or on `[MCPAction]` for per-action accuracy on action-based tools.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Category` | `string` | `"Uncategorized"` | Groups related tools in `search_tools` results (set on `[MCPTool]`) |
| `ReadOnlyHint` | `bool` | `false` | Operation does not modify any state |
| `DestructiveHint` | `bool` | `false` | Operation may perform irreversible changes |
| `IdempotentHint` | `bool` | `false` | Same arguments always yield the same result |
| `OpenWorldHint` | `bool` | `false` | Operation interacts with systems outside Unity |
| `Title` | `string` | `null` | Human-readable display title (set on `[MCPTool]`) |

### Parameter constraints

Constraints are included in the JSON Schema sent to AI assistants:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Enum` | `string[]` | Valid values for string parameters |
| `Minimum` | `double` | Minimum value for numeric parameters |
| `Maximum` | `double` | Maximum value for numeric parameters |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Adding custom resources</summary>

Resources expose read-only data to AI assistants via URI patterns. Use `[MCPResource]`:

```csharp
using UnityMCP.Editor;
using UnityEngine;

public static class MyCustomResources
{
    [MCPResource("unity://player/stats", "Current player statistics")]
    public static object GetPlayerStats()
    {
        var player = GameObject.Find("Player");
        if (player == null)
            return new { error = "Player not found" };

        return new
        {
            position = player.transform.position,
            health = player.GetComponent<Health>()?.CurrentHealth ?? 0,
            isGrounded = player.GetComponent<CharacterController>()?.isGrounded ?? false
        };
    }
}
```

Resources are read via `resources/read` using their URI (e.g., `unity://player/stats`). They are automatically discovered on domain reload.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Adding custom prompts</summary>

Prompts provide reusable workflow templates for AI assistants. Use `[MCPPrompt]`:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityMCP.Editor;
using UnityMCP.Editor.Core;

public static class MyCustomPrompts
{
    [MCPPrompt("debug_gameobject", "Debug a GameObject by inspecting its state")]
    public static PromptResult DebugGameObject(
        [MCPParam("name", "Name of the GameObject to debug", required: true)] string name,
        [MCPParam("verbose", "Include full component details (true/false)")] string verbose = "false")
    {
        bool isVerbose = verbose?.ToLower() == "true";

        string instructions = $@"Debug the GameObject ""{name}"" using these steps:

1. Use `find_gameobject` with search_term=""{name}"" to locate it
2. Use `manage_component` with action=""inspect"" to check each component";

        if (isVerbose)
        {
            instructions += $@"
3. Use `read_console` with filter=""{name}"" to check for related log messages";
        }

        return new PromptResult
        {
            description = $"Debug instructions for '{name}'",
            messages = new List<PromptMessage>
            {
                new PromptMessage
                {
                    role = "user",
                    content = new PromptMessageContent
                    {
                        type = "text",
                        text = instructions
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Adding custom recipes</summary>

Recipes are reusable scene setup templates invoked via `execute_recipe`. Use `[MCPRecipe]` on a static method:

```csharp
using UnityMCP.Editor;

public static class MyRecipes
{
    [MCPRecipe("my_scene_setup", "Creates a custom scene layout")]
    public static object MySceneSetup(
        [MCPParam("size", "World size", Minimum = 10, Maximum = 500)] float size = 50)
    {
        // Create your scene objects here...
        return new { success = true, summary = "Scene created" };
    }
}
```

Recipes are automatically discovered on domain reload and appear in `list_recipes` output.
